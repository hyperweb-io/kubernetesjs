A command-line interface for interacting with Kubernetes clusters, built with TypeScript.

## Installation

```sh
npm install -g @kubernetesjs/cli
```

## Usage

The CLI provides several commands for managing Kubernetes resources. You can use either `k8s` or `kubernetes` as the command prefix:

```sh
k8s <command> [options]
# or
kubernetes <command> [options]
```

Options:
-  `--client-url`: Kubernetes API server URL (default: http://localhost:8001)


### Available Commands

#### Get
Retrieve information about Kubernetes resources.

```sh
k8s get <resource> [options]
```

#### Apply
Apply configurations to your Kubernetes cluster.

```sh
k8s apply -f <file> [options]
```

#### Delete
Delete resources from your Kubernetes cluster.

```sh
k8s delete <resource> <name> [options]
```

#### Describe
Show detailed information about a specific resource.

```sh
k8s describe <resource> <name> [options]
```

#### Logs
View logs from pods.

```sh
k8s logs <pod-name> [options]
```

#### Port Forward
Forward ports from pods to your local machine.

```sh
k8s port-forward <pod-name> <local-port>:<pod-port> [options]
```

#### Exec
Execute commands in a container.

```sh
k8s exec <pod-name> -- <command> [options]
```

#### Cluster Info
Display information about the current cluster.

```sh
k8s cluster-info
```

#### Config
Manage Kubernetes configuration.

```sh
k8s config [options]
```

## Examples

### Get Pod Information

```sh
k8s get pods
```

### Apply a Configuration File

```sh
k8s apply -f deployment.yaml
```

### View Pod Logs

```sh
k8s logs my-pod
```

### Port Forward to a Service

```sh
k8s port-forward my-pod 8080:80
```

## Configuration

The CLI uses the default Kubernetes configuration from `~/.kube/config`. You can specify a different configuration file using the `--kubeconfig` option.

## Development

When first cloning the repo:

```sh
yarn
# Build the production packages
yarn build
```

For development with source maps:

```sh
yarn
# Build with source maps for better debugging
yarn build:dev
```
